# markdown-core

*markdown-core* is a tiny library offering a certain version, set of extensions, and configuration of
[flexmark](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java), a Markdown parser and HTML generator,
and a certain version of [PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml).
The rationale for markdown-core is using the same combination of libraries and configuration in multiple other tools and thus, producing the same rendering results.
